        The idea to create this project came from one of my favorite games from my childhood: Ratchet Deadlocked.
        In it, you could pilot an amazing Spider Robot that felt great.
        It’s flaw was that it was unable to walk on walls, only on regular ground.
        That’s what I wanted to accomplish with this project:
        a spider that was able to walk on almost any given surface.

        <p>
            This robotic spider is capable of many things (including mass destruction of virtual worlds).
            <br /><br />
            One of its key features is the ability to walking on different kinds of surfaces, even on ceilings!
            <br /><br />
            It also has some secondary features,
            like a simple but cool weapon system and a collision detection mechanism,
            that activates an energy shield when colliding with certain types of objects.
